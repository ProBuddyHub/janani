## 🔍 Problem Statement

Every year, thousands of women and newborns in India face complications due to inadequate prenatal and postnatal care. Due to lack of awareness, education, affordability, and access to hospitals, health issues are often unnoticed until it's too late. Most rural women visit hospitals only once or twice throughout their pregnancy, if at all.
